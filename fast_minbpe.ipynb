    "I just watched [Karpathy's BPE video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zduSFxRajkE) (thanks Andrej for all the fun videos!) and got inspired. Karpathy's code is really nice (as always), and [his implementation](https://github.com/karpathy/minbpe) is obviously not meant to be fast, _but_, we **can** make the code much faster without sacrificing clarity too much. Hopefully, faster code can make experimentation (e.g. with different scores, instead of always taking the most popular pair) easier. So... here's my late night take on simple, clean, but faster BPE!\n",
