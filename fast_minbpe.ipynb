    "Heavily inspired by Karpathy's, here's my late night take on a simple, clean, and fast BPE implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm borrowing a lot from Karpathy's code, but we'll use more efficient data-structures:\n",
    "1. We'll transform our sequence into a sequence of pairs, which we will hold in a [*Leap*](datastructures/leap.py). This will allow efficient merging.\n",
    "2. We'll calculate the pair counts only once, and hold them in a [*Multiset*](datastructures/multiset.py). This will allow efficiently finding the next pair to merge.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [*Leap*](datastructures/leap.py) is a data structure that I came up with for this (please lmk if it already has a name!). It represents an ordered list, and allows efficient iteration over items both by position and by value. It also allows for constant time insertion/appending.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [*Multiset*](datastructures/multiset.py) is functionally equivalent to the built-in `collections.Counter`. The cost of initialization and updates are a bit higher for the Multiset, but finding the top element takes constant time, making it drastically faster for our purposes (see [multiset_tests.ipynb](datastructures/multiset_tests.ipynb)).\n",
    "\n",
    "# Why is minbpe slow?\n",
    "\n",
    "If we are to perform N merges, and the length of the training sequence is L, Karpathy's original impl does (I think):\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for i in range(N):\n",
    "    calc_stats()        # O(L)\n",
    "    find_max()          # O(L)\n",
    "    do_merges()         # O(L)\n",
    "```\n",
    "For a total complexity of O(N*L) (maybe I'm neglecting some factors).\n",
    "\n",
    "# Why is fast_minbpe fast?\n",
    "\n",
    "Using our `Leap` and `Multiset`, we instead get:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "stats = calc_stats()              # O(L)\n",
    "for i in range(N):\n",
    "    find_max()                    # O(1)\n",
    "    do_merges_and_update_stats()  # O(M_i + log(L))\n",
    "```\n",
    "Where M_i denotes the actual number of merges we perform at the ith iteration. Note that M_1+M_2+...+M_n <= L - 1, so the overall complexity of evertyhing (again neglecting logarithmic factors) is O(L)!\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll unfortunately have to give up some lovely code from Karpathy's implementation, such as:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "pair = max(stats, key=stats.get)\n",
    "```\n",
    "That said, armed with the implementations of the `Leap` and the `Multiset`, the rest of our code remains concise and clean I think.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that I only implement the functionality of Karpathy's `BasicTokenizer`.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can find some more details in [this post](https://yanivle.github.io/ai/2024/02/23/fast_minbpe.html)."
