    "Heavily inspired by Karpathy's, here's my late night take on a simple, clean, and fast BPE implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm borrowing a lot from Karpathy's code, but we'll use more efficient data-structures:\n",
    "1. We'll hold the sequence in a [*Leap*](leap.py) so we can efficiently _find_ the pairs to merge and _perform_ the merge.\n",
    "2. We'll compute the stats only _once_ at the beginning, and during training just _update_ the relevant parts.\n",
    "3. We'll maintain the counts in a [slightly-modified max-heap](heapykiyay.py), so finding the max element would be logarithmic.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we are to perform N merges, and the length of the training text is L, Karpathy's original impl does (I think):\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for i in range(N):\n",
    "    calc_stats()        # O(L)\n",
    "    find_max()          # O(L)\n",
    "    do_merges()         # O(L)\n",
    "```\n",
    "For a total complexity of O(N*L) (maybe I'm neglecting some factors).\n",
    "\n",
    "With (1), (2), and (3) above, we instead get:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "stats = calc_stats()            # O(L)\n",
    "for i in range(N):\n",
    "    find_max()                  # O(1)\n",
    "    do_merges_and_update_stats  # O(Mi + log(L))\n",
    "```\n",
    "Where Mi denotes the actual number of merges we perform at the ith iteration. Note that M1+M2+...+Mn <= L - 1, so the overall complexity of evertyhing (again neglecting logarithmic factors) is O(L)!\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, we'll have to give up this lovely line from Karpathy's code:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "pair = max(stats, key=stats.get)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Karpathy's concise code is so nice, but this linear `max` operation is costing us a lot :)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that I only implement the functionality of Karpathy's `BasicTokenizer`.\n",
    "\n",
